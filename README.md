# Design a REST API - Design First (NO CODE)

Before diving into the assignment, make sure you review the slides and understand the theortical part and best practices.

## Plan with your group mates:

- What my data should look like
- What are the entities that we should have ie (Products and Users)
- What is the relation between these entities (you could read about it, and we will cover that in the next lectures)
- What kind of endpoints the API would have
- Document the endpoints using Swagger (documentation only, NO CODE)

Make sure you cover the basic routes first.
